Academic C# OOP programming

This repository includes 6 laboratory works in C# which are using concepts, principles and patterns of OOP. Here you can see how my codestyle has changed during the six months studying of the OOP course and what design patterns I have used for my system

It should be mentioned that the code for each laboratory work was not written in order to be functional and fully implement any system. Certainly, in each laboratory for full-fledged work, you need to add a Presentation layer and a Data access layer. I have been engaged mostly in the business logic layer, so you can evaluate it here.
