Academic C# OOP programming

This repository includes 6 laboratory works in C# using concepts, principles and patterns of OOP. Here you can see how my codestyle has changed in six months of studying the OOP course and what design patterns I used for my system

It should be mentioned that the code for each laboratory work was not written in order to be functional and fully implement any system. Naturally, in each laboratory for full-fledged work, you need to add a Presentation layer and a Data access layer. I have been closely engaged only in Business logic layer and that is what you can evaluate here.
